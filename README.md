## 🔹 About Me  
I am a **data science and machine learning** professional with **19+ years of experience** in **AI-powered recommendation engines, pricing optimization, credit scoring, loss forecasting, fraud detection, and building large-scale ML pipelines**. My expertise lies in **predictive modeling, model validation, and AI-driven business analytics** for fintech, banking, payment, e-commerce, real estate, investment, and platform industries.

## 🏦 Financial Modeling
- **Credit Scorecard**: Creating risk-based underwriting scorecards leveraging logistic regression, XGBoost, and deep learning models.
- **Loss Forecasting**: Developing robust models to predict credit losses using macroeconomic factors, delinquency trends, and time-series analysis.
- **Fraud Detection**: Implementing anomaly detection models using unsupervised learning (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) and supervised learning (CatBoost, XGBoost).
- **Residual Value Modeling**: Forecasting vehicle residual values using econometric models like PROC MIXED and machine learning approaches.
- **Pricing Optimization**: Optimizing pricing strategies using reinforcement learning, JD Power competitive rate analysis, and market elasticity modeling.
- **Interest Rate Forecasting**: Predicting interest rate trends through time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) and economic indicators.
- **Behavioral Score (Collection Model)**: Developing early-stage delinquency prediction models for efficient collection strategies.

## 📊 Marketing & Customer Analytics
- **Churn Prediction (Retention)**: Building ML models to identify customers at risk of attrition, utilizing survival analysis and XGBoost.
- **Propensity (Return to Market) Model**: Developing models to predict customer likelihood of returning to market based on behavioral signals and transaction data.
- **Customer Satisfaction (Sentiment Score) Model**: Using NLP techniques (BERT, LLMs) to extract sentiment insights from customer reviews, survey responses, and service interactions.
- **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)**: Analyzing the effectiveness of various marketing channels through econometric regression and Bayesian inference.
